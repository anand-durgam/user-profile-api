Middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform various tasks such as modifying the request and response objects, ending the request-response cycle, and calling the next middleware in the stack.

In this application,
To apply the requestLogger middleware to the entire application, app.use(requestLogger) is used. This means that the requestLogger will be executed for every incoming request, providing information about the request to the console.
Additionally, To apply the middleware selectively to specific routes or route groups. For instance, app.use('/api/users', requestLogger) applies the requestLogger middleware only to routes that fall under the /api/users path. This allows for more granular control over where the middleware is applied in the application.

Middleware plays a crucial role in Express.js applications by enabling developers to customize and enhance the request-handling process. It is commonly used for tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more. Middleware can be applied globally to the entire application or selectively to specific routes or route groups, providing flexibility and control over the request-response flow.
